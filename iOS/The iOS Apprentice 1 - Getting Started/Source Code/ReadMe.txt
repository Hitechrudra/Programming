This folder contains two versions of the source code for the Bull's Eye game:

Source-Plain: This is the game before any of the custom graphics were added.
It just uses the standard UIKit controls.

Source-Pretty: This is the final version of the game. If you've worked your way
through the entire lesson, then this is what you should have ended up with.

To both versions I added a lot of comments to show you what every piece of code
does. I also removed anything that was inserted by the Xcode template that isn't
actually needed for this game, so that the code is as simple as possible.
